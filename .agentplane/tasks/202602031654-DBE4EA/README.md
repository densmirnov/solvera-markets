## Summary

Commit baseline documentation and roadmap prior to Stage 1 tasks.

## Scope

Add ROADMAP.md and docs/01-11 baseline files.

## Risks

Risk of mixing baseline docs with Stage 1-specific docs. Mitigation: exclude ABI events doc from this commit.

## Verify Steps

1. ROADMAP.md and docs/01-11 files present. 2. docs/12-abi-events.md excluded. 3. git status shows only intended doc additions.

## Rollback Plan

Revert the commit to remove baseline documentation files.

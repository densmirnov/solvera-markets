## Summary

Update ROADMAP with Dokploy-based deployment and docker compose requirements.

## Scope

Add explicit docker compose and Dokploy steps to release path.

## Risks

Risk of roadmap drift vs implementation. Mitigation: update roadmap immediately with containerization constraints.

## Verify Steps

1. ROADMAP includes Dokploy and docker compose tasks. 2. No unrelated sections modified.

## Rollback Plan

Revert the commit to restore previous roadmap.

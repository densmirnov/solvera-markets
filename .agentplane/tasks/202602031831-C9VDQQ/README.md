## Summary

Update ROADMAP with SKILL.md for frontend and agent-first backend API requirements.

## Scope

Add SKILL.md task under frontend and agent-first API note under backend in ROADMAP.

## Risks

Risk of mismatch with implementation. Mitigation: update ROADMAP only with requirements, not details.

## Verify Steps

1. ROADMAP mentions SKILL.md under frontend. 2. Backend section mentions agent-first API endpoints.

## Rollback Plan

Revert the commit to restore previous ROADMAP.

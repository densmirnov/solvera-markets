## Summary

Removed host port bindings in docker-compose and documented Dokploy isolation/routing to prevent port conflicts.

## Scope

Updated docker-compose.yml to use expose for backend/frontend and added Dokploy isolation guidance in docs/22-devops-dokploy.md.

## Plan

1. Implement the change for "Dokploy port isolation and compose adjustments".
2. Run required checks and capture verification evidence.
3. Finalize task findings and finish with traceable commit metadata.

## Risks

Removing host port bindings means local access requires explicit port publishing or a reverse proxy; ensure Dokploy domain routing is configured.

## Verify Steps

docker compose up -d --build

## Verification

<!-- BEGIN VERIFICATION RESULTS -->
<!-- END VERIFICATION RESULTS -->

## Rollback Plan

Revert docker-compose.yml and docs/22-devops-dokploy.md to restore host port bindings.

## Findings

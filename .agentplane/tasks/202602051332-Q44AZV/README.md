## Summary

Draft a 5-minute English micro-pitch and save it to HACKATHON.md.

## Scope

HACKATHON.md pitch content only.

## Risks

Pitch could over/under-shoot 5-minute timing; adjust length if needed.

## Verify Steps

Manual: read HACKATHON.md and confirm clarity, timing, and required attribution.

## Rollback Plan

Delete or revert HACKATHON.md changes.

## Summary

Rewrite HACKATHON.md pitch to 2-3 min direct speech with agent-first focus and Base mainnet note.

## Scope

HACKATHON.md content only.

## Risks

Pitch may still be too long/short for delivery pace; adjust in rehearsal.

## Verify Steps

Manual: read HACKATHON.md to confirm required points and 2-3 min length.

## Rollback Plan

Revert HACKATHON.md to previous pitch.

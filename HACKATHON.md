# Solvera Markets — 2–3 Minute Pitch (Direct Speech)

Hi judges. I’m going to be brief and direct.

Solvera Markets is an agent‑first marketplace for DeFi outcomes. It’s designed for AI agents that can’t easily interact with DeFi today. Here, they can.

The core idea is simple: an agent publishes an intent — a desired result — and locks the required funds. Examples: “I want $100 of USDT/ETH LP tokens,” or “I want at least 1,000 USDT and I’m offering 1,000 USDT.” Another agent can fulfill that intent via a single atomic transaction. If the transaction is correct, the reward is transferred automatically and the solver’s karma increases. Outcomes, not tasks.

This solves the trust and coordination problem. Buyers get results. Solvers get paid fairly. And the system is transparent because the critical actions are on‑chain.

If an agent doesn’t have its own wallet, the platform provides a local agent wallet primitive, so any agent can safely interact with crypto without heavy setup.

Integration is straightforward: all interactions are described in a universal format in `SKILL.md`. Any compatible agent can use the system immediately. A test version is already live on Base mainnet, so this isn’t a mock — it’s usable today.

I built this solo end‑to‑end, using my own AI framework to accelerate architecture, implementation, and verification.

In short: Solvera Markets turns “hire an agent” into “buy an outcome,” with atomic settlement, reputation, and an agent‑first API. Thank you — I’m happy to demo the flow.

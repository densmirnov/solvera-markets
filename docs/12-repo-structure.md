# Repository structure and checks

## Structure
- `contracts/` — smart contracts and tests.
- `indexer/` — event indexer.
- `backend/` — API layer.
- `frontend/` — operator UI.
- `docs/` — project documentation.
- `scripts/` — utilities and checks.
- `tests/` — cross-project tests.

## Checks
- `make check` runs structural validation and fmt/lint/test.
- Scripts run relevant tools when configuration exists.

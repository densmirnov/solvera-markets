# Indexer Model (The Graph)

The subgraph turns on-chain events into a queryable model for UI and API.

## Indexed Entities
- **Intent**: status, parameters, escrow values.
- **Bid**: solver, bond, status.
- **Settlement**: outcomes and timestamps.

## Why It Matters
- Real-time visibility into contract state.
- Easy inspection of intent lifecycle without decoding logs.

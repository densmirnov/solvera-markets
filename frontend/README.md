# Frontend

## Purpose
This folder will host the minimal operator UI for Solvera Markets. The UI is intended for monitoring, not for end users.

## Structure
- `src/` — UI sources (to be added).

## Key principles
- Agent-first system: UI is for observability only.
- Reads from backend API, never from RPC directly.

## Entry points
- Build and run commands will be defined when the UI is implemented.
